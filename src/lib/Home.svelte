  This site is dedicated to my research. A bit about me:
</p>

<p>
  I obtained a BASc in engineering science in 2010 from the University of Toronto, 
  specializing in aerospace engineering. I then went to the University of Michigan, where I obtained
  an MEng in aerospace engineering in 2011, an MS in pure mathematics in 2014, and a PhD in aerospace 
  engineering in 2015 under my adviser, <a href={socials.ilya} target="_blank" title="Ilya Kolmanovsky">Ilya Kolmanovsky</a>.
</p>
<p>
  My career has been varied and taken me to different places as I have come to explore different themes.
  I started off as an aerospace engineer specializing in constrained control and control of aerospace and
  automotive systems. I have worked substantially on control of automotive engines, dynamic control of both
  automotive and space vehicles, control of transportation, and made significant theoretical contributions to the
  control of systems subject to constraints.
</p>
<p>
  At some point, I became interested in the emerging technology of blockchain and began to explore applications 
  of the theory of dynamic games to tokenomics. Much of this research has not yet seen the light of day because at
  some point I left the ivory tower and began to engage in the messy world of entrepreneurship.
